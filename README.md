📊 __Profitability Peaks:__ June had the highest monthly profit ($7.8K), indicating efficient cost management or premium pricing during that period.

📉 __Loss Month:__ February posted a loss of $179.09, despite having the lowest quantity sold—indicative of cost overrun or discounts.

💡 Face Moisturizing Products stand out with a mix of high and low-performing SKUs; further SKU-level analysis can identify cost-inefficient items.

## Recommendations
Optimize Low-Performing Months: Address February’s inefficiencies; reassess pricing, promotional spend, and cost structure.

Focus on High-Margin Items: Products like “Sterling Frost Ring” and “Gold Spectrum Anklet” show healthy margins and should be scaled.

SKU Rationalization: Consider dropping or repackaging products like “Sterling Whisper Bracelet” and “Golden Blaze Necklace” that contribute minimally to revenue and margin.

Category Expansion Strategy: Explore deeper performance data for categories like Body Care and Make Up, which contribute the majority of sales and profit (based on previous dashboards).
